    <h1>SAT&reg; Reading Tips</h1>

    <ul>
        <li>Fictional passages always have a shift in tone. Look for this as you are reading.</li>
        <li>For paired passages, try using the following process:
            <ul>
                <li>Read Passage 1, Answer Passage 1 Questions</li>
                <li>Read Passage 2, Answer Passage 2 Questions</li>
                <li>Answer Synthesis Questions</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>A variety of questions are linked, in which the first question is a general close reading question and the second question asks you to “Find The Evidence” from the text to support your answer. If you're having trouble answering the first question, you can always go to the second question, locate the pieces of evidence in the passage, and work backward to get your answer.</li>
        <li>There is evidence in the passage for every correct answer. Try to find something in the passage that supports your answer.</li>
        <li>Don't read into what is being implied or what could be correct. It's all explicit evidence.</li>
        <li>Do your best not to bring in outside information (i.e. if you know a lot about the subject of the passage, set that aside).</li>
        <li>Some questions will have multiple answer choices with evidence in the passage. Make sure your answer is also relevant to the question.</li>
    </ul>
