    <h1>SAT&reg; Writing Tips</h1>

    <p>The SAT&reg; Writing section has questions that follow patterns. Practice is very helpful in recognizing this. Additionally, here are some specific content notes to remember:</p>
    
    <ul>
        <li>Ignore prepositional phrases 
            <ul>
                <li>e.g. <em>Each of the men is working.</em> “Of the men” is irrelevant here, “each” is all that matters for agreement)</li>
            </ul>
        <li>Its' is not a word</li>
        <li>Semicolons separate two independent clauses. If the sentence would't stand on its own, you can't use a semicolon. Usually, a semicolon is used instead of a period if the two sentences are very closely connected in subject.</li>
        <li>Colons are used for expanded definitions or to introduce a list. They must be preceded by an independent clause.</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="sidebar">One other thing to note: the shortest answer is frequently the correct one. Don't take this too far, but it may be helpful for guessing.</p>
