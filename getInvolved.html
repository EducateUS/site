    <h1>Get Involved</h1>

    <h4>Who can join</h4>
    <p class="generalInfo">Junior and Senior year students at the Early College at Guilford are able to tutor with
        EducateUS. This is because underclassmen will be in class during the 3:30 to 4:30 tutoring timeframe. No
        previous experience or training is required. Tutors can join any time of the year and are able to attend as many
        or as few sessions as they are able. If you cannot drive yourself, see our
        <a class="miniLink" href="transportInfo.html">transportation information</a> to learn more about how we can help
        you.
    </p>

    <h4>Why should you join</h4>
    <p class="generalInfo">
        EducateUS is an amazing community service opportunity, providing a consistent source of volunteer hours. Each
        tutor earns 1 hour of service for tutoring, with carpooling drivers earning an additional hour.
