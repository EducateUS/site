    <h1>Get to Know the SAT&reg;</h1>

    <p>The SAT&reg; consists of 4 main sections: Reading, Writing, Math (No calculator), and Math (Calculator). However, it
        is important to note that there is a 5th section as well, which could consist of content from any one of the
        previous sections. This section does not count for your score, so don't worry!</p>

    <p>Here's what CollegeBoard has to say:</p>
    <blockquote>
        "The SAT tests subjects you cover in school: reading, math, and writing and language. [The test] takes
        three hours and consists of three tests: (1) the Reading Test, (2) the Writing and Language Test, and (3) the
        Math Test. Most of the questions are multiple choice, though some of the math questions ask you to write in the
        answer rather than select it. On all questions, there's no penalty for guessing: if you're not sure of the
        answer, it's better to guess than leave the response blank."
    </blockquote>

    <p>
        To register for the SAT, you will need a recent photo of yourself (for your test ID). You will also need to pay
        the $60 fee or request a fee waiver. Alternatively, the school SAT administration takes place in the spring.
