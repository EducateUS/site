    <p>The SAT consists of 4 main sections: Reading, Writing, Math (No calculator), and Math (Calculator). However, it is important to note that there is a 5th section as well, which could consist of content from any one of the previous sections. This section does not count for your score, so don't worry!</p>
    <p>Here's what CollegeBoard has to say:</p>
    <blockquote>"The SAT tests subjects you cover in school: reading, math, and writing and language. [The test] takes three hours and consists of three tests: (1) the Reading Test, (2) the Writing and Language Test, and (3) the Math Test. Most of the questions are multiple choice, though some of the math questions ask you to write in the answer rather than select it.        On all questions, there's no penalty for guessing: if you're not sure of the answer, it's better to guess than leave the response blank."</blockquote>
