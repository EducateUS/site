    <p class="generalInfo">
        EducateUS is currently tutoring at Kernodle Middle School every Tuesday after school from 3:30-4:30. Our tutors
        are available to answer any questions about math, reading, science, or social studies. We are happy to help
        students review old content or guide them as they learn something new.
    </p>

            <div class="quote">I'm currently a senior at ECG. I enjoy tutoring as it allows me to make a positive
                difference in my community by helping students. I've always enjoyed math, and tutoring provides an
                outlet for me to turn this academic interest into a service initiative. </div>

            <div class="quote">Hey all! I'm a senior at ECG that loves all things sports. I run cross country at
                Northwest Guilford and love to watch football and basketball. I'm very close with my older sister 
                and younger brother. We have three pets: a large black cat, a yellow lab, and small cava-poo who just 
                had puppies. I love to tutor because I love the people I do it with. Being able to help students with 
                the same content I once stuggled through is extremely rewarding</div>

            <div class="quote">Hello! I'm Jiya, and I'm a senior! I love the outdoors and run cross country! I like
                playing video games and have a very chunky 11-year Rottweiler named coco! If you ever see me, I
                would be more than happy to show you some pics of her! :) I think tutoring is a great way to get
                that extra help on subjects you feel a bit uneasy about, and tutoring at Educate US is awesome! It's
                very laid back, and everyone at Kernodle is really nice! Learning about the students and seeing them
                make new friends is also a major plus! :) </div>
