    <h1>SAT&reg; Math Tips</h1>

    <p>There’s a reason why most top colleges have a higher average score in math than in reading/writing — it is easier to improve on the math section than the reading section, since this section is way more predictable. Regular practice on this section is very helful.</p>
    <h3>Calculator Use</h3>
    <p>Know how to use your calculator effectively &mdash; take practice tests with the calculator you'll be using! Remember that you don't have to use a calculator for every calculator active question.
