    <h1>SAT&reg; Math Tips</h1>

    <p>There's a reason why most top colleges have a higher average score in math than in reading/writing â€” it is easier
        to improve on the math section than the reading section, since this section is way more predictable. Regular
        practice on this section is very helful.</p>
    
    <h3>Calculator Use</h3>
    
    <p>
        Know how to use your calculator effectively &mdash; take practice tests with the calculator you'll be using!
        Remember that you don't have to use a calculator for every calculator active question.
    </p>

    <h3>Avoiding Careless Mistakes</h3>

    <p>Remember that the answer choices are geared towards answers you might get if you made a mistake. Make sure that you are actually answering the problem. For example, if a question asks you to solve for <em>2x</em>, you might want to circle that so you don't accidentally solve for <em>x</em>.</p>

    <h3>Time Management</h3>

    <p>SAT&reg; Math questions generally get harder as they go. Remember this, especially towards the end. The hardest multiple choice will be followed by an easier grid-in, so you may want to skip ahead and get those points if you get stuck.</p>
